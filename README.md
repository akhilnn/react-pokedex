# React Pokédex Lite
Project 4 (MERN-stack Application)


## Introduction

This app was developed to partly mimic the functionality of a Pokédex, where a user can add to a list of Pokémon that he/she has seen and read more about a Pokémon's details. The Pokémon information is retrieved from the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co).<br>
